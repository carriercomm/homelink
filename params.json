It is written using the Grails web framework.\r\n\r\nUsers will be able to create a 'family' that other users can connect to. When a new list, reminder, or chore is created, the user will have the option to create the item for the family, or for themselves. This will allow family members to post to-dos, chores, or other items for the entire family to see, or just for personal use.\r\n\r\nThe application is currently in the beginning stages of development, and more features will be implemented with time.\r\n\r\nYou can check out a demo of the application at [homelink.caseyscarborough.com](http://homelink.caseyscarborough.com).\r\n\r\nA screenshot of the application in it's current state can be viewed below:\r\n\r\n![alt text][screenshot1]\r\n\r\nDependencies\r\n------------\r\n- Java Development Kit 6 or greater\r\n- Groovy 2.1.3\r\n- Grails 2.2.2\r\n- MySQL (optional)\r\n\r\nFor the development environment, the application uses the default Grails in-memory database, H2. The MySQL database can also be set up if desired by creating a database locally, then changing the dataSource settings on lines 15-38 of the <code>DataSource.groovy</code> file located in the application's <code>grails-app/conf/</code> directory. The settings for MySQL are shown below:\r\n\r\n```groovy\r\ndataSource {\r\n\tdbCreate = \"create-drop\" // Can be changed to 'create', 'update', or 'validate'\r\n\turl = \"jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/homelink\"\r\n\tdriverClassName = \"com.mysql.jdbc.Driver\"\r\n\tusername = \"root\"\r\n\tpassword = \"\"\r\n\tproperties {\r\n\t\tmaxActive = 100\r\n\t\tmaxIdle = 25\r\n\t\tminIdle = 5\r\n\t\tinitialSize = 10\r\n\t\tminEvictableIdleTimeMillis = 60000\r\n\t\ttimeBetweenEvictionRunsMillis = 60000\r\n\t\tmaxWait = 10000\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nRunning the Application\r\n-----------------------\r\n\r\nTo run the application, download the repository and unzip it or clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:\r\n```\r\ngit clone http://github.com/caseyscarborough/homelink.git\r\n```\r\nRun the following commands from a terminal window with the <code>homelink</code> directory as the working directory:\r\n```\r\ngrails upgrade  # If your version of Grails is greater than 2.2.2\r\ngrails run-app\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter running the commands, you can navigate to [http://localhost:8080/homelink][homelink] in your web browser to see the application in action.\r\n\r\nUsing the Application\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\nAfter opening the HomeLink application in the browser, you can login using the username <code>casey</code> and the password <code>password</code> to view the application with sample data populated, or you may create your own account and populate your own.\r\n\r\nAs of now, there are two main sections, Shopping and Reminders.\r\n\r\n### Shopping\r\n\r\nThe shopping section is a place used to keep track of all of your shopping lists. Lists are added through the small AJAX form at the bottom of the page. Each list is added to the 'accordion' group, and from there you may add items to that list from the small form inside. Lists and items can be deleted by clicking the &times; symbol next to the item or list.\r\n\r\n### Reminders\r\n\r\nThe reminders section, not surprisingly, is used to keep track of reminders. The page displays a list of all of your reminders from oldest to newest. You click the reminders to view more information about them or click the &times; symbol to delete them. New reminders can be created using the form at the bottom of the page. If a reminder has 'expired', or if the remind date is past the current date, the date will be displayed in red.\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n\r\nThe todos section is very similar in layout to the shopping section. You can create todo lists, and add items to each one using the forms provided. Lists or items can be deleted in the same way as before, by clicked its respective &times; symbol.\r\n\r\n### Email Functionality\r\n\r\nIf you'd like the application to send emails, you must change the settings for the mail plugin in the <code>grails-app/conf/Config.groovy</code> file around line 70 (shown below). \r\n\r\n```groovy\r\ngrails {\r\n\tmail {\r\n\t  host = \"smtp.gmail.com\"\r\n\t  port = 465\r\n\t  username = \"yourusername@gmail.com\"\r\n\t  password = \"yourpassword\"\r\n\t  props = [\"mail.smtp.auth\":\"true\",\r\n\t\t\t   \"mail.smtp.socketFactory.port\":\"465\",\r\n\t\t\t   \"mail.smtp.socketFactory.class\":\"javax.net.ssl.SSLSocketFactory\",\r\n\t\t\t   \"mail.smtp.socketFactory.fallback\":\"false\"]\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThese settings are currently set up for a Gmail account, and the only settings you need to change are the username and password fields. Change these to your Gmail address and password and users will be able receive automated emails from the application.\r\n\r\nView more information on using the mail plugin at [http://grails.org/plugin/mail][grails-mail].\r\n\r\n[screenshot1]: https://github.com/caseyscarborough/homelink/raw/master/img/main.png \"The application's main layout.\"\r\n[homelink]: http://localhost:8080/homelink\r\n[grails-mail]: http://grails.org/plugin/mail","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
